## 💡 Example Conversations

### Example 1: Anxiety Support
```
You: "I'm feeling really anxious about my presentation"

Bot: "I hear that you're feeling anxious. That must be 
      difficult. Let's work through this together. Your 
      anxiety is valid, and it's brave of you to acknowledge it.

      💡 Quick Tip
      Take 3 deep breaths. Inhale slowly through your nose, 
      hold for 3 seconds, exhale through your mouth.

      🧘 Exercise: 4-7-8 Breathing
      Breathe in for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale for 8. 
      Repeat 4 times. (2 minutes)

      ✨ You are safe. This feeling will pass. Breathe slowly. 🌊"
```

### Example 2: Stress Relief
```
You: "Work has been so overwhelming lately"

Bot: "Stress can be really challenging. Let's find ways 
      to help you feel more at ease. I notice your stress 
      levels have been high lately.

      🌟 Activity: Take a 10-minute walk outside 🚶

      🧘 Exercise: 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding
      Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 
      2 you smell, 1 you taste. (3 minutes)

      ✨ Take a deep breath. You are doing better than 
      you think. 🌬️"
```

### Example 3: Positive Moment
```
You: "I had such a great day! Everything went right!"

Bot: "I'm so glad to hear you're feeling good! What's 
      contributing to your positive mood? Your positive 
      energy is inspiring! Keep nurturing what makes you 
      feel good.

      ✨ You are valued and important. Never forget that. ✨"
